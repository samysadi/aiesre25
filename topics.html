                <p><strong>Daniel Cook</strong> has served as the President of Conservation Solutions Corporation
                    since 1993. The company works with healthcare, commercial, industrial,
                    multifamily, and institutional building owners to reduce energy, water, and chemical
                    use and costs through innovative technologies, expertise, and services. Additionally,
                    Conservation Solutions helps commercial buildings and educational facilities
                    enhance indoor air quality and improve performance for students and workers by
                    implementing UVC systems and air filtration. In healthcare settings, such as
                    hospitals, UVC systems are used to reduce Hospital Acquired Infections and
                    Ventilator-Associated Pneumonias, while also saving energy and improving
                    ventilation within HVAC systems.</p>

                <h4>Energy Management and Storage with Bio-Based Phase Change
                    Materials</h4>
                <p>This talk will focus on the role of Bio-Based Phase Change Materials (BioPCMs) in
                    advancing thermal energy storage and energy management. Derived from renewable
                    vegetable oils, BioPCMs offer a wide temperature range for storing latent energy, from
                    -70°C to 175°C, with minimal expansion and contraction. They are non-toxic,
                    biodegradable, and stable for over 100 years of thermal cycling, providing 24 times
                    the thermal energy storage of concrete. These properties make BioPCMs ideal for
                    improving the efficiency of systems like Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS),
                    solar heating, and HVAC systems, reducing peak demand, lowering equipment size,
                    and enhancing system reliability.</p>
                <p>BioPCM systems have demonstrated effectiveness in several applications, such as
                    reducing heat generated during battery discharge, optimizing domestic hot water
                    systems by reducing heat pump size by 50%-65%, and minimizing short cycling in
                    chillers, leading to significant cost and energy savings. Moreover, BioPCMs can be
                    integrated into portable systems for logistics, cold storage, and refrigerated transport,
                    ensuring sustainable temperature control. The talk will also explore how these
                    advancements in thermal storage, alongside innovations in Battery Management
                    Systems (BMS), hybrid energy storage, and smart grids, contribute to renewable
                    energy integration, grid stability, and the broader transition to a low-carbon,
                    sustainable future.</p>

                <h4>Efficient Deep Learning for 3D/4D Shape Analysis: From Medical
                    Applications to Generative AI</h4>
                <p>In this talk, Professor Laga will present his group's research on 3D and 4D
                    computer vision, focusing on the challenging problem of reconstructing 3D
                    shapes and motions of natural and manmade objects, such as humans and
                    animals, from RGB images and videos. Despite extensive research, this
                    remains an unsolved, ill-posed problem. He will first highlight the importance
                    of this topic across fields such as biology, medicine, autonomous driving, and
                    virtual/augmented reality. Then he will explore the use of deep neural
                    networks for inferring 3D shape and motion, emphasizing their potential
                    over traditional geometry-driven techniques, while also discussing their
                    limitations, such as their black-box nature, high power consumption, and
                    computational cost. He will conclude by showcasing their latest work, which
                    delves into the mathematical foundations of neural networks, offering more
                    accurate, explainable, and efficient formulations. Professor Laga will
                    demonstrate these advancements in representing high-resolution, large-
                    scale images for applications like remote sensing, space exploration, digital
                    art, and digital health, as well as in 3D world reconstruction and dynamic
                    shape analysis. Additionally, he will discuss the statistical modeling of static
                    (3D) and dynamic (4D) shapes using the Square Normal Fields (SRNF)
                    framework, which supports applications in growth modeling, medical
                    diagnosis, and generative AI for 3D/4D reconstruction and generation from
                    images, videos, and text.</p>

                <h4>Smart Battery and Hybrid Energy Storage Systems for Electric
                    Vehicles and Drones: Advanced Energy Management Strategies and
                    Applications</h4>
                <p>Dr. Mesbahi’s talk will explore the integration of smart battery systems and
                    hybrid energy storage solutions, combining batteries and supercapacitors,
                    for electric vehicles, drones, and domestic applications. He will focus on
                    advanced energy management strategies using advanced control techniques
                    and AI algorithms to optimize efficiency, predict the state of health and
                    extend the lifespan of energy systems. A case study on the ELCOD project,
                    which developed the Stork Mk.1 UAV, a long endurance hybrid-propulsion
                    system combining a hydrogen fuel cell (PEMFC) and a LiPo battery is
                    presented. This study highlights how hybridization can mitigate the durability
                    challenges of hydrogen fuel cells by optimizing fuel cell sizing for cruising
                    power and using complementary energy sources (e.g., batteries or
                    supercapacitors) for peak loads. The talk also compares fixed and adaptive
                    frequency-based energy management strategies and emphasizes the key
                    role of supercapacitor state of charge in enhancing system performance and
                    longevity in EV and drone applications.</p>
