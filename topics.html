                <p>Thermal Energy Storage presents a significant opportunity to reduce peak load energy demand and
                    reduce the size of HVAC
                    equipment. Reducing peak demand lowers the power requirements to maintain the grid, improve electric
                    load and heating,
                    cooling and process system reliability.</p>

                <h4>Other Phase Change Materials</h4>
                <p>Phase change materials such as ice have a limited range in which to optimize latent energy storage at
                    32°F and have issues with
                    expansion and contraction shortening equipment life. Eutectic salts have a larger range in which to
                    store latent energy but have
                    issues with corrosion and a shorter operating life.</p>
                <h4>BioPCM Advantages</h4>
                <p>Bio-Based Phase Change Materials (BioPCMs) are renewably derived from vegetable oils and their
                    by-products. They have a wide
                    range of opportunities to set melt / freeze temperature from minus 70°C up to 175°C. They have
                    minimal expansion and
                    contraction issues with solid-to-gel, or solid-to-solid transitions. Latent heat of fusion varies
                    from 150-275 kJ/kg.</p>
                <p>1” of BioPCM stores as much thermal energy as 24” of concrete and has tunable thermal conductivity
                    from 0.1-10 W/mK.
                    BioPCMs are non-toxic and biodegradable with long term stability >100 years of thermal cycling with
                    no thermal degradation.</p>
                <h4>Optimize Battery Energy Storage Efficiency</h4>
                <p>Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are used as power protection systems for data centers (DC) and
                    in large utility power
                    distribution systems to provide back-up electricity during a power outage. During an outage when the
                    batteries discharge, a large
                    amount of heat is generated. The installed HVAC systems draw a significant part of the stored
                    battery power to offset this
                    generated heat. This reduces the power delivered downstream and reduces resiliency.</p>
                <p>BioPCM systems have successfully offset approximately 41kW of heat generated by battery discharge
                    over a 4-6 hour window
                    and deliver the greatest amount of downstream electrical power using only 400 watts of power to
                    maintain the shelter at 25°C
                    with the BioPCM system during an event.</p>
                <h4>Hot and Chilled Water System Storage Opportunities</h4>
                <p>Other applications include thermal storage for solar water heating systems, geothermal systems,
                    enabling hot water (boiler) and
                    chilled water (Chiller) HVAC system peak demand to be reduced, and provide back-up heating and
                    cooling when system go down
                    as well as many other applications including agriculture, pharma and manufacturing.</p>
                <h4>Reduce Chiller or Boiler Short Cycling and Save Energy</h4>
                <p>Successful projects include reducing short cycling of chillers for a large manufacturer resulting in
                    a 50% reduction in maintenance
                    costs and 22% energy savings.</p>
                <h4>Domestic Hot Water Systems - Reduce Heat Pump Size</h4>
                <p>Storing large amounts of latent energy enables the thermal energy storage system footprint to be
                    significantly reduced. BioPCM
                    can be coupled with heat pumps to enable a 50% - 65% reduction in heat pump size for domestic hot
                    water systems with a much
                    smaller footprint than a water storage tank.</p>
                <h4>Portable Bio Based Phase Change Units</h4>
                <p>Portable Bio-based phase change systems are designed to satisfy the needs of a wide range of
                    applications in the logistics
                    industry, cold storage facilities and industrial applications weather it is heating or cooling to
                    maintain reliable temperature
                    control.</p>
                <h4>Cold Chain Logistics / Refrigerated Truck Transportation</h4>
                <p>Bio-based phase change systems can be installed in trucks to maintain desired temperatures to
                    complete last-mile approach with
                    sustainability at the forefront.</p>

                <h4>Challenges of Renewable Energy Integration in Clean Energy
                    Systems</h4>
                <p>In this talk, Professor Blaabjerg will address the complex transition
                    from fossil-based energy to renewables. This shift necessitates highly
                    efficient power electronics technology for energy conversion,
                    distribution, and end-user applications. Professor Blaabjerg will focus
                    on the role of advanced power electronics and control solutions in
                    integrating renewable energies such as wind and photovoltaics into the
                    grid, addressing issues of technology development, power converter

                <h4>Efficient Deep Learning for 3D/4D Shape Analysis: From Medical
                    Applications to Generative AI</h4>
                <p>The analysis of 3D and 4D (3D + time) shapes is crucial across diverse
                    fields, from biology and medicine to computer graphics and virtual reality.
                    Shape deformation over time is a key feature of many natural and man-
                    made objects, such as anatomical structures, facial expressions, and human
                    body movements. Understanding and modeling these deformations, along
                    with the variability in shape, has applications in medical diagnosis, growth
                    modeling, and animation. In this talk, Pr. Laga will describe his research on
                    statistical modeling of static (3D) and dynamic (4D) shapes, focusing on the
                    development of the Square Normal Fields (SRNF) framework for efficient 3D
                    shape representation, comparison, and population modeling. The talk will
                    also delve into statistical analysis of 4D shape data, particularly for
                    applications in growth and disease progression, and highlight the role of
                    these models in advancing deep learning and generative AI for 3D/4D
                    reconstruction and generation from images, videos, and text.</p>
